Target completion time 120 hrs

Make presentation for each phase individually (add to Drive, push to git, notify on Trello)

Gain basic proficiency in relevant technologies/libraries [23% - 27.6 hrs]:
	Jupyter Notebook
	Pandas
	Numpy
	Matplotlib
Read and become familiar with published description of dataset [6% - 7.2 hrs]:
	Overview
	Indicators (4000)
Explore each dataset and ascertain which indicators are most relevant [23% - 27.6 hrs]:
	Filter unnecessary columns (exclusionary)
	Check for missing values
	Seperate any categorical values from numerical ones
	Check categorical values for relevancy
	Isolate remaining numerical, boolean and enumerated values as primary interest
	Check for outliers
	Explore distribution of binary and numerical columns
	Determine which variables indicate:
		Which countries have a strong potential client base
		How will this potential evolve for each country using prospective data (determine pertinent timeframe)
		How do countries rank by number of current and potential near-term clients
Clean the dataset [14% - 16.8 hrs]:
	Narrow the number of relevant columns to no less than 4
	Remove duplicates
	Remove or substitute missing values
	Remove values outside pertinent timeframe
	Remove countries of insufficient population size
	Remove or substitute outliers
Analyze the dataset [18% - 21.6 hrs]:
	Generate graphs for the mean, median and standard deviation of each selected variable for each country
	Consider composite graphs if they seem more illustrative
	Rank countries by attractiveness
Prepare presentation (slideshow) [16% - 19.2 hrs]:
	Justify reasoning for choosing indicators as relevant
	Describe how variables were ordered by precedence
	Display and explain generated visualizations for several of the highest and lowest ranked countries to contrast
	Give ranked list of countries
